I am Zhouyuan Chen, a graduate student studying at the New York University Courant Institute, interested in Computer Graphics(especially for geometry processing and numerical simulation). I am fortunate to have the opportunity to work in the [NYU Geometric Computing Lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/people.html) now, supervised by Professor [Daniele Panozzo](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/daniele.html) and Professor [Daniel Zint](https://daniel-zint.github.io/). Before that, I worked on medical model software development, supervised by Professor [Jiazhou Chen](https://californiachen.github.io/) at Zhejiang University of Technology.

My name could be pronounced like Chow-Yan Chan, you can also call me Cavers if it is easier for you to pronounce.

If you ask me why Graphics? The answer must be that graphics is the most romantic thing I can imagine!
