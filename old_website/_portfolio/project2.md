## Rendering Engine Toy

In this project, I read three handy books written by Peter Shirley and implemented the basic raytracying rendering engine step by step. After that, I read the book Advanced Global Illumination in order to get more details.

I think this should be my first time getting in touch with the real Computer Graphics.
