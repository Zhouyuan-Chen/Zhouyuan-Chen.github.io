## Simulation

With online tutorial(tenMinutePhysics/CSC417-physics-based-animation), I self-schooled some simulation stuff, FEM and fluid simulation.

Actually, this field is harder than I thought. I spent too much time on reading related materials and figuring out what is happening for the formula and the algorithms, LOL.
